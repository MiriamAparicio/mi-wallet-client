## Tecnologies

For the frontend (this repository) I used Angular CLI as a project generator.
Also [Materialized](https://materializecss.com/) framework for the styling, [ChartJs](https://www.chartjs.org/) for the charts, and [Material Design](https://material.io/) style guide.

For the backend [Mi-Wallet-Api](https://github.com/MiriamAparicio/mi-wallet-api) I used Express generator, and some packages, the more interesting is [PubSub-JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pubsub-js) that is a messaging pattern that provides greater network scalability.

The local database was [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/), and [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) as a local server.
And [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) as a cloud platform for the deployment.
